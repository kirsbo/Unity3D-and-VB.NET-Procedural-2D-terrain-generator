I had a game project which needed a random terrain generator for tile-maps. The result was essentially a set of simple algorithms that generates a 2D tile-map (only one elevation level), and then populates the tile-map with procedurally generated terrain.

First a prototype in VB.NET was made that contains all the algorithms. This prototype is contained in this repo.

2D prototype in VB.NET


Subsequently I ported it to Unity3D in C#, to make it usable for the project. While the Unity source is not available, the algorithms used can however be gleaned from the 2D prototype.

A short description of the algorithms used / approach:

The approach used is by others referred to as using "ants" for creating the random terrain.

First, a tile-map is generated by using a two-dimensional rectangular array (x,y) of a specialized tile class. The tile class holds tile related information such as drawpoint, and terrain type.

Then, a special "ant" class is created, which can be thought of as an invisible entity that takes "steps" around the tile-map. Every time the ant moves to a new tile, the underlying terrain type is changed. The ant can move in 8 directions and it changes direction, every time it has moved one tile. The direction it takes after each step is random.

Next, spawn either a fixed or random amount of ants with a fixed or random amount of lifetime. Lifetime is the amount of tiles it can traverse / step to, before being removed.

To be able to control what kind of terrain is most common, a "terrain type" array is used. This array contains a list of the terrain types (basically just an int). To get equal balance between all types of terrain, you add only one of each terrain type to the terrain type array. If you wanted a certain terrain type to be more common, you would add further entries to the array, with that particular terrain type.

Then when the ant needs to determine what terrain to change, a look-up in the terrain type array is made, using a random integer as the array index.

It takes a bit of tweaking the parameters (ant amount, ant lifetime, terrain type array), but the results are pretty good.

It could be further enhanced by using more sophisticated types of ant classes, that for example traversed in specialized patterns etc. For making believable islands in a ocean, you'd probably want to modify the ant behavior so they have some constraints in terms of which way to move (so you don't randomly get long "spikes" of land , very dispersed small islands etc).

Finally, a short description of how to use the VB.NET app, as is.
